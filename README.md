As a data scientist, projects are not always there for you to work on. You have to create them and convince your boss (e.g., your CEO) to fund that. Before your project is officially launched, you have to conduct many steps to make that happen. Here are the checklist of things that you should do during the project initiation.
1) Identify and motivate the problems that you want to address in your project.
2) Conduct literature search to understand the state of arts and the gap for solving the problem.
3) Formulate the data science problem in details (e.g., clas- sification vs. predictive modeling vs. clustering problem). 
4) Identify clearly the success metric that you would like to use (e.g., AUC, accuracy, recall, speedup in running
time).
5) Setup the analytic infrastructure for your project (including both hardware and software environment, e.g., AWS or local clusters with Spark, python and all necessary packages).
6) Discover the key data that will be used in your project and make sure an efficient path for obtaining the dataset. This is a crucial step and can be quite time-consuming, so do it on the first day and never stops until the project completion.
7) Generate initial statistics over the raw data to make sure the data quality is good enough and the key assumption about the data are met.
8) Identify the high-level technical approaches for the project (e.g., what algorithms to use or pipelines to use). 
9) Prepare a timeline and milestones of deliverables for the entire project.
All the above steps in project initiation should be demonstrated in your proposal.
